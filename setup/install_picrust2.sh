# Script:  install_picrust2.sh
# Purpose:
#   - Create a dedicated conda environment (named "picrust2" by default) and install
#     PICRUSt2 (Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction
#     of Unobserved States) into it from the bioconda channel, following the
#     official installation instructions published by the Huttenhower Lab:
#     https://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/picrust/
#   - No version is pinned by default. Set PICRUST2_PACKAGE_SPEC (for example,
#     "picrust2=2.6.3") when a project-specific version constraint is needed.
#   - Linux only. The script exits before making changes on other operating
#     systems.
#

#
# Prerequisite:
#   - A Linux system with a working conda installation (Miniconda or Anaconda)
#     must already be
#     present on this machine and available on the PATH. This script does
#     NOT install conda itself.
#   - If conda is not yet installed, follow the official installation guide
#     before running this script:
#     https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/install/index.html
#
# Usage (run from the repository root):
#   chmod +x setup/install_picrust2.sh
#   ./setup/install_picrust2.sh
#
# Optional configuration without editing this file:
#   PICRUST2_CONDA_ENV_NAME=picrust2_project \
#   PICRUST2_PACKAGE_SPEC='picrust2=2.6.3' \
#   ./setup/install_picrust2.sh

# Together these prevent the script from silently continuing after a failure
